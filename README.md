# Interview tasks

A collection of interviewing tasks that are not covered by any
NDA. However, the tasks and their descriptions could be changed.

The tasks themselves are more likely to be asked on the interview,
than could be converted into a complete project.

- [FizzBuzz](fizzbuzz) - Several (stupid?) ways to write fizzbuzz
- [Price Match](price_match) - The task is to write a function that
  validates the output of a black-box algirithm
- [Brackets](brackets) - Validate that a sequence is a valid brackets
  set. Extended version.
